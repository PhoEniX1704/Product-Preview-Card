## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Bulma - CSS Framework
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

- In this project, I enhanced my skills in using Bulma, a modern CSS framework based on Flexbox. 
- I also learned how to structure a responsive card component with optimized layouts for different screen sizes.

### Continued development

- In future projects, I want to continue improving my responsive design skills and explore more CSS frameworks and libraries. 
- Additionally, I aim to learn more about JavaScript to add interactivity to my web projects.

### Useful resources

- Bulma Documentation (https://bulma.io/documentation/) - This helped me understand the various utility classes provided by Bulma and how to use them effectively in my project.
- Frontend Mentor (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges) - For providing the challenge and improving my front-end skills through realistic projects.
